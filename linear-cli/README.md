# linear-cli

`linear-cli` is an agent-native Linear runtime for Claude Code, Codex, and other automation that needs a stable command surface instead of screen scraping or ad-hoc GraphQL scripts. this fork of [`schpet/linear-cli`](https://github.com/schpet/linear-cli) keeps the git and [jj](https://www.jj-vcs.dev/) workflow ergonomics from upstream, then layers on stable JSON contracts, startup discovery, dry-run previews, operation receipts, and workflow-safe error semantics for agent-controlled execution.

if you want an agent to read Linear state, resolve refs, preview a write, apply it, and return structured output without leaving the shell, this repo is designed for that path first. `main` now reflects the current `v3` runtime direction: core surfaces default to machine-readable output, startup flows are non-interactive, human-oriented terminal output is an explicit escape hatch, and source-adjacent intake can flow through normalized context envelopes instead of wrapper-specific glue code.

```bash
linear capabilities
linear capabilities --compat v1
linear resolve issue ENG-123
linear resolve pack --issue ENG-123 --workflow-state started --label Bug
linear issue update ENG-123 --state done --dry-run --json
linear issue list
linear issue view ENG-123
linear issue create -t "Backfill webhook contract docs" --team ENG --dry-run --json
linear issue update ENG-123 --state done --comment "Shipped in v2.10.0"
linear issue create --team ENG --context-file slack-thread.json --dry-run --json
linear issue update ENG-123 --context-file slack-thread.json --apply-triage --dry-run --json
linear issue update ENG-123 --context-file slack-thread.json --autonomy-policy suggest-only --dry-run --json
linear project view "Automation Contract v3"
linear notification list
```

the core agent surfaces now default to machine-readable JSON. use `--text` when a human wants terminal-oriented output for ad-hoc inspection or debugging.

## what the v3 runtime means

the `v3` line is where `linear-cli` stops behaving like a mixed human/agent CLI and starts behaving like an agent-native control plane by default.

- startup discovery defaults to the richer `linear capabilities` schema
- startup-critical reads and representative writes default to machine-readable JSON
- prompt fallbacks are no longer implicit; use `--profile human-debug --interactive` when a maintainer explicitly wants them
- `agent-safe` is the default execution profile
- preview/apply/result flows share `operation`, `receipt`, and structured `error.details`
- source-adjacent intake can use `--context-file`, `--apply-triage`, `--autonomy-policy`, and `receipt.sourceProvenance` as first-class runtime surfaces

if you are integrating `linear-cli` into an agent runtime, assume the defaults above and treat `--text` plus `--profile human-debug` as secondary debugging tools.

## agent-native runtime

Treat `linear-cli` as a shell-native control plane for agents:

- startup discovery comes from `linear capabilities`
- startup-critical reads and core write surfaces default to machine-readable JSON
- refs can be normalized with `linear resolve ...`, including multi-entity `linear resolve pack`
- write previews use `--dry-run --json`
- write results expose `operation`, `receipt`, and structured `error.details`
- `linear capabilities` classifies commands as `stable`, `partial`, or `escape_hatch`
- source-adjacent intake can carry deterministic context, triage, autonomy policy, and provenance through `--context-file`
- human/debug behavior is explicit with `--text` and `--profile human-debug --interactive`

The practical default loop is:

1. `linear capabilities`
2. `linear resolve ...`
3. default-JSON reads such as `linear issue view ENG-123`
4. `--dry-run --json` previews for writes
5. apply the mutation and inspect `operation`, `receipt`, and `error.details`

## for agents

If an agent only reads one page, it should be this README plus the two contract docs below.

- start with `linear capabilities` for the default schema-like discovery shape; use `linear capabilities --compat v1` only when an older consumer still expects the legacy startup shape
- use the default runtime for predictable non-interactive agent execution; `--profile human-debug` is the explicit escape hatch for pager and prompt-driven debugging
- resolve ambiguous issue/team/state/user/label refs with `linear resolve ...` before previewing or applying writes; use `linear resolve pack` when a workflow needs one shared issue/team/user/project context object
- prefer stable read surfaces such as `issue`, `project`, `cycle`, `milestone`, `document`, `webhook`, `notification`, `team`, `user`, `workflow-state`, `label`, `initiative`, and update feeds; those agent-first entrypoints now default to machine-readable JSON
- preview writes with `--dry-run --json` before mutating Linear
- apply writes on default-JSON surfaces without `--text`, then inspect exit codes and `error.details` instead of parsing terminal text
- use `--profile human-debug --interactive` for human/debug prompt flows; missing required inputs now fail fast by default
- use stdin or file flags for Markdown-heavy descriptions and comments instead of long inline shell strings
- use `--context-file` when upstream tooling can hand `linear-cli` a normalized source-context envelope for create/update flows
- use `--apply-triage` with `--context-file` when the envelope already carries deterministic team/state/label hints
- use `--autonomy-policy suggest-only | preview-required | apply-allowed` to decide whether source-adjacent intake may only suggest, must preview, or may apply
- inspect `receipt.sourceProvenance` after apply when the source-adjacent intake path needs a machine-readable audit trail back to Slack, tickets, or other upstream context

## migration from 2.x

If a downstream consumer still assumes the older mixed human/agent behavior, migrate in this order:

1. stop parsing styled terminal output
2. use `linear capabilities` for startup discovery and pin `--compat v1` only where a legacy consumer still needs it
3. treat `operation`, `receipt`, and `error.details` as the canonical execution surface
4. add `--text` anywhere a maintainer still wants terminal-oriented output
5. add `--profile human-debug --interactive` anywhere a maintainer still wants prompts or pager-oriented debugging

The detailed release and migration guide lives in [docs/agent-only-v3.md](docs/agent-only-v3.md). For copy-pasteable before/after fixes, use [docs/v2-to-v3-migration-cookbook.md](docs/v2-to-v3-migration-cookbook.md).

## human-debug demos

These demos are intentionally secondary. they show the explicit human/debug escape hatch, not the primary runtime path for agents.

## install

for agents and scripts, prefer a pinned install in the repo or runtime you control.

### install as a skill

If you want to expose `linear-cli` as a reusable skill on top of an existing agent runtime, install it from the repo root and select the public skill explicitly:

```bash
npx skills add https://github.com/kyaukyuai/linear-cli --skill linear-cli
```

This is the most compatible form for `skills` and `skills.sh`.

If you want to point directly at the skill directory instead, this also works:

```bash
npx skills add https://github.com/kyaukyuai/linear-cli/tree/main/skills/linear-cli
```

Once installed, agents can load the skill and then call the local `linear` binary using the agent-first guidance in [skills/linear-cli/SKILL.md](skills/linear-cli/SKILL.md).

### npm / bun / pnpm

install as a dependency to pin a version in your project:

```bash
npm install -D @kyaukyuai/linear-cli
# or
bun add -D @kyaukyuai/linear-cli
# or
pnpm add -D @kyaukyuai/linear-cli
```

then run via your package manager:

```bash
npx linear issue list
bunx linear issue list
```

## agent-facing capabilities

compared to upstream, this fork adds and maintains capabilities aimed at automation-heavy workflows:

- stable JSON contracts for the automation tier, with machine-readable failures for parser, validation, and runtime errors
- a self-describing `linear capabilities` surface with richer schema and output metadata by default and an explicit `--compat v1` fallback for legacy consumers
- `--dry-run` previews for high-value write commands, including `issue start`, issue writes, and non-issue writes
- additive operation receipts on high-value JSON write success paths
- source-adjacent intake receipts now carry machine-readable source provenance when `--context-file` is used
- a shared top-level `operation` contract on representative preview/apply JSON write paths
- stdin and pipeline support for high-value write paths
- normalized source-context intake for issue create/update through `--context-file`
- deterministic triage preview/apply for source-adjacent intake through `--apply-triage`
- explicit source-intake autonomy policies through `--autonomy-policy suggest-only|preview-required|apply-allowed`
- retry-safe semantics for relation add/delete, project label add/remove, notification read/archive, and structured partial-failure details
- canonical `--yes` confirmation bypass handling for destructive commands
- agent-focused help examples across automation-tier and major write commands
- cycle workflows beyond listing and viewing, including `cycle current`, `cycle next`, `cycle create`, `cycle add`, and `cycle remove`
- issue workflow commands for `search`, `assign`, `move`, `priority`, `estimate`, `label add/remove`, comment delete, relations, and attachments
- inbox notification commands for `list`, `count`, `read`, and `archive`
- webhook commands for `list`, `view`, `create`, `update`, and `delete`
- workflow state commands for `list` and `view`
- user commands for `list` and `view`
- project label commands for `list` and `project label add/remove`
- initiative commands for `list` and `view`, plus project update and initiative update feeds
- JSON output for scripting across issue, cycle, project, milestone, initiative, document, webhook, notification, and update-feed commands
- workspace-aware auth management with keyring migration and default workspace support
- generated AI-agent skill docs, Claude plugin metadata, npm publishing, and Homebrew tap release plumbing

## automation contract

for bot and org-wide automation use cases, `linear-cli` defines a stable machine-readable contract for a focused automation tier. that contract is the primary runtime surface. `--text` and prompt flows are secondary human/debug escape hatches.

to discover the curated agent-facing command surface programmatically, use `linear capabilities`. the default shape now returns the richer v2 schema metadata for agent-native startup. when an older consumer still expects the trimmed legacy shape, pin it explicitly with `linear capabilities --compat v1`.

the default capabilities shape now carries parser-oriented metadata for representative commands, including repeatable/variadic inputs, deprecated aliases, default values, composition constraints, and concrete resolution sources such as env vars, config keys, git branch context, jj trailers, and implicit stdin fallbacks.

`agent-safe` is now the default execution profile for agent-controlled runs. it disables pager-by-default behavior, extends the built-in write timeout to `45000ms` unless `--timeout-ms` or `LINEAR_WRITE_TIMEOUT_MS` is set, and keeps destructive confirmation bypass explicit with `--yes`. use `--profile human-debug` when a maintainer explicitly wants prompt-driven or pager-oriented debugging behavior.

non-goals:

- it does not force `--json` on commands outside the agent-native default-JSON surface
- it does not auto-confirm destructive actions
- it does not replace explicit human/debug prompt flows; callers should pass flags, stdin, file inputs, or opt into `--profile human-debug --interactive`

runtime surface classes:

- `stable`: startup-contract or automation-contract surface. safe for primary agent runtime paths.
- `partial`: agent-usable surface with shared dry-run or machine-readable traits, but not a full stable contract. pin explicit flags and avoid assuming long-term shape stability.
- `escape_hatch`: intentionally raw or human/debug-only path, such as `linear api`, `--text`, or `--profile human-debug --interactive`.

- v1 in scope: `issue list/view/create/update --json`, `issue relation add/delete/list --json`, `issue comment add --json`, `team members --json`, `issue parent/children/create-batch --json`
- v2 additions: `project list/view --json`, `cycle list/view/current/next --json`, `milestone list/view --json`
- v3 additions: `document list/view --json`, `webhook list/view --json`, `notification list/count --json`
- v4 additions: `team list/view --json`, `user list/view --json`, `workflow-state list/view --json`, `label list --json`, `project-label list --json`
- v5 additions: `initiative list/view --json`, `project-update list --json`, `initiative-update list --json`
- v6 additions: `resolve issue/team/workflow-state/user/label --json`
- v7 additions: `issue assign/estimate/move/priority --json`, `notification read/archive --json`, `project create --json`, `project label add/remove --json`, `webhook create/update/delete --json`
- v8 additions: `resolve pack --json`
- partial surfaces today include high-value dry-run adopters that do not yet expose a stable apply contract, such as `document create/update/delete`, `milestone create/update/delete`, `project update/delete`, and `issue start`
- escape-hatch only surfaces include non-JSON terminal flows, `linear api`, and explicit human/debug output paths

the contract fixes top-level success payload shapes and requires machine-readable failure payloads for the automation tier. see [docs/json-contracts.md](docs/json-contracts.md) for the full contract, compatibility rules, and example payloads. that guarantee also covers parser and argument validation failures when the command is in machine-readable mode, whether that is the default or was requested explicitly with `--json`.

for automation consumers, auth and authorization failures now use exit code `4`, free-plan or workspace-plan limit failures use exit code `5`, and client-side write confirmation timeouts use exit code `6`. other contract failures remain non-zero and currently use `1`. rate-limited responses remain on exit code `1`, but now include retry guidance and, when available, `error.details.rateLimit` metadata.

high-value write commands honor `LINEAR_WRITE_TIMEOUT_MS` and accept `--timeout-ms` for per-command overrides. timeout failures return a distinct machine-readable failure mode, `timeout_error`, with `error.details.failureMode = "timeout_waiting_for_confirmation"`. when reconciliation runs after the timeout, `error.details.outcome` still captures the high-level result, while `error.details.appliedState` and `error.details.callerGuidance` tell callers whether the write looks applied, partially applied, not applied, or still uncertain and whether they should retry, resume, or read first. notification `read` and `archive` now use the same timeout contract as issue write commands.

the same document also defines the shared preview contract for future `--dry-run` write commands. those commands are not all implemented yet, but the contract now fixes the expected `stdout`, `exit code`, and `--json --dry-run` envelope shape ahead of rollout.

representative preview/apply JSON write paths may add a top-level `operation` field so agents can diff preview intent against apply results with one parser path. successful high-value JSON writes may also add a top-level `receipt` field. this gives agents a shared place to inspect `operationId`, `resolvedRefs`, `appliedChanges`, `noOp`, and `nextSafeAction` without inferring those traits from command-specific payload fields. current coverage includes issue create/update/comment/relation, issue batch creation, issue assignment/estimate/move/priority, project create and label add/remove, webhook create/update/delete, and notification read/archive.

destructive commands use `--yes` as the canonical confirmation-bypass flag. legacy `--force` and `--confirm` flags are still accepted where older workflows already depended on them.

for retry behavior, prefer treating write commands in three buckets:

- retry-safe set-style writes: `issue update` without `--comment`, plus relation add/delete
- retry-safe no-op writes: `project label add/remove` and `notification read/archive`, which succeed without mutating when the target state is already satisfied
- non-idempotent writes: `issue create`, `issue comment add`, and `issue update --comment`
- resumable but non-idempotent batch writes: `issue create-batch`, which reports `error.details.createdIdentifiers` and `failedStep` on partial failure

when a write command completes part of its work and then fails, `error.details` uses a shared partial-success shape with `failureStage`, `retryable`, and `partialSuccess`. for example, `issue update --comment --json` sets `error.details.partialSuccess.issueUpdated = true` and includes a standalone retry command for `issue comment add`.

For stdin and pipeline behavior, see [docs/stdin-policy.md](docs/stdin-policy.md).

## differences from upstream

this fork is intentionally diverging from upstream in a few ways:

- package and publishing identity use `kyaukyuai/linear-cli`, `@kyaukyuai/linear-cli`, and `kyaukyuai/tap/linear`
- maintainer workflows are standardized around git-based release automation, even though the CLI itself still supports both git and jj at runtime
- documentation and release assets are tailored for this fork's roadmap, including agent-facing docs and additional release infrastructure
- changelog and README content track fork-specific features separately from upstream history

## setup

1. create an API key at [linear.app/settings/account/security](https://linear.app/settings/account/security)[^1]

2. authenticate with the CLI:

   ```sh
   linear auth login --profile human-debug --interactive
   ```

3. configure your project:

   ```sh
   cd my-project-repo
   linear config --profile human-debug --interactive
   ```

For unattended agent runtimes, prefer injected credentials and explicit config over prompt flows. see [docs/authentication.md](docs/authentication.md) for multi-workspace support and other authentication options.

the CLI works with both git and jj version control systems:

- **git**: works best when your branches include Linear issue IDs (e.g. `eng-123-my-feature`). use `linear issue start` or linear UI's 'copy git branch name' button and [related automations](https://linear.app/docs/account-preferences#git-related-automations).
- **jj**: detects issues from `Linear-issue` trailers in your commit descriptions. use `linear issue start` to automatically add the trailer, or add it manually with `jj describe`, e.g. `jj describe "$(linear issue describe ABC-123)"`

## commands

### issue commands

the current issue is determined by:

- **git**: the issue id in the current branch name (e.g. `eng-123-my-feature`)
- **jj**: the `Linear-issue` trailer in the current or ancestor commits

note that [Linear's GitHub integration](https://linear.app/docs/github#branch-format) will suggest git branch names.

```bash

linear issue parent ENG-123 --json    # emit the parent issue, or null when absent
linear issue children ENG-123 --json  # emit child issues for decomposition workflows
```

For short inline text, `-d/--description` is fine. For Markdown content, prefer `--description-file <path>` or pipe content on stdin to avoid shell escaping issues.

`issue create-batch` expects a JSON file shaped like:

```json
{
  "team": "ENG",
  "project": "Roadmap",
  "parent": {
    "title": "Manager bot rollout",
    "description": "Coordinate rollout work",
    "state": "started"
  },
  "children": [
    { "title": "Add issue list JSON", "assignee": "self" },
    { "title": "Add issue view JSON", "dueDate": "2026-04-15" }
  ]
}
```

`issue create-batch` creates the parent first and then creates each child in order. If a later child fails, already created issues are not rolled back. Use `--dry-run --json` to preview the plan first. In `--json` mode, partial failures include `error.details.createdIdentifiers` and `error.details.failedStep` so automation can resume from the remaining work instead of rerunning the same batch unchanged.

linear completions     # generate shell completions
```

## configuration options

the CLI supports configuration via environment variables or a `.linear.toml` config file. environment variables take precedence over config file values.

| option          | env var                  | toml key          | example                    | description                           |
| --------------- | ------------------------ | ----------------- | -------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| Team ID         | `LINEAR_TEAM_ID`         | `team_id`         | `"ENG"`                    | default team for operations           |
| Workspace       | `LINEAR_WORKSPACE`       | `workspace`       | `"mycompany"`              | workspace slug for web/app URLs       |
| Issue sort      | `LINEAR_ISSUE_SORT`      | `issue_sort`      | `"priority"` or `"manual"` | how to sort issue lists               |
| VCS             | `LINEAR_VCS`             | `vcs`             | `"git"` or `"jj"`          | version control system (default: git) |
| Download images | `LINEAR_DOWNLOAD_IMAGES` | `download_images` | `true` or `false`          | download images when viewing issues   |

the config file can be placed at (checked in order, first found is used):

- `./linear.toml` or `./.linear.toml` (current directory)
- `<repo-root>/linear.toml` or `<repo-root>/.linear.toml` (repository root)
- `<repo-root>/.config/linear.toml`
- `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/linear/linear.toml` or `~/.config/linear/linear.toml` (Unix)
- `%APPDATA%\linear\linear.toml` (Windows)

## skills

linear-cli includes a skill that helps AI agents use the CLI effectively. for use cases outside the CLI, it includes instructions to interact directly with the graphql api, including authentication.

### claude code

install the skill using [claude code's plugin system](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/skills):

```bash
# from claude code
/plugin marketplace add kyaukyuai/linear-cli
/plugin install linear-cli@linear-cli

# from bash
claude plugin marketplace add kyaukyuai/linear-cli
claude plugin install linear-cli@linear-cli

# to update
claude plugin marketplace update linear-cli
claude plugin update linear-cli@linear-cli
```

### skills.sh for other agents

install the skill using [skills.sh](https://skills.sh):

```bash
npx skills add kyaukyuai/linear-cli
```

view the skill at [skills.sh/kyaukyuai/linear-cli/linear-cli](https://skills.sh/kyaukyuai/linear-cli/linear-cli)

### clawhub publish for maintainers

if you want to publish the generated skill to ClawHub, use the `skills/linear-cli/` directory as the publish target.

> **note:** the CLI is `clawhub`, not `clawdhub`

```bash
cd skills/linear-cli
npx clawhub@latest login
npx clawhub@latest whoami
npx clawhub@latest publish . \
  --slug kyaukyuai-linear-cli \
  --name "Linear CLI" \
  --version 2.1.0 \
  --changelog "Refresh skill docs for linear-cli v2.1.0" \
  --tags latest
```

guidance:

- publish from `skills/linear-cli/`, not the repository root
- keep `--slug kyaukyuai-linear-cli` and `--name "Linear CLI"` stable unless the public skill identity changes
- when the skill matches a CLI release, prefer using the same version as `deno.json` and `CHANGELOG.md`
- if the skill contents changed but no CLI release was cut, bump the skill version independently before publishing
- run `deno task generate-skill-docs` first if command help or skill references changed

the generic `linear-cli` slug is already taken on ClawHub, so this fork publishes as `kyaukyuai-linear-cli`.

## development

### release operations

maintainer release and publish recovery steps are documented in [docs/release-runbook.md](docs/release-runbook.md).

### updating skill documentation

the skill documentation in `skills/linear-cli/` is automatically generated from the CLI help text. after making changes to commands or help text, regenerate the docs:

```bash
deno task generate-skill-docs
```

this will:

- discover all commands and subcommands from `linear --help`
- generate reference documentation for each command
- update the `SKILL.md` file from `SKILL.template.md`

**important:** the CI checks will fail if the generated docs are out of date, so make sure to run this before committing changes that affect command structure or help text.

### code formatting

ensure code is formatted consistently:

```bash
deno fmt
```

the project uses deno's built-in formatter with configuration in `deno.json`. formatting is checked in CI.

## why

linear's UI is incredibly good but it slows me down. i find the following pretty grating to experience frequently:

- switching context from my repo to linear
- not being on the right view when i open linear
- linear suggests a git branch, but i have to do the work of creating or switching to that branch
- linear's suggested git branch doesn't account for it already existing or having a merged pull request

this cli solves this. it knows what you're working on (via git branches or jj commit trailers), does the work of managing your version control state, and will write your pull request details for you.

[^1]: creating an API key requires member access, it is not available for guest accounts.
