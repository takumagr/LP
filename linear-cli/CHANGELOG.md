# Changelog

## [3.2.0] - 2026-04-13

### Added

- added normalized source-adjacent intake for `issue create` and `issue update` through `--context-file`, so upstream tooling can hand the CLI a deterministic external-context envelope instead of wrapper-specific markdown glue
- added deterministic source triage preview/apply support for source-adjacent intake, including `--apply-triage` and explicit `--autonomy-policy suggest-only|preview-required|apply-allowed` controls
- added source provenance to write receipts and a stable `linear resolve pack --json` context-pack surface so multi-entity agent workflows can resolve shared issue/team/user/project context in one step

### Changed

- refreshed the README, runtime docs, and generated skill guidance so the current `v3` runtime explains source-adjacent intake as a first-class agent path

## [3.1.0] - 2026-04-05

### Added

- expanded Automation Contract v7 across remaining high-value write surfaces, including issue assignment, estimate, move, priority, notification read/archive, project create and project-label mutations, and webhook create/update/delete flows
- enriched `linear capabilities` with more parser-complete metadata such as aliases, repeatability, variadic inputs, defaults, canonical examples, resolution sources, and stronger machine-readable constraints
- added machine-readable surface classification to `linear capabilities`, distinguishing `stable`, `partial`, and `escape_hatch` runtime surfaces for agent callers

### Changed

- expanded downstream certification from a single generic suite into named startup-monitor, control-plane, diagnostics, compatibility-bridge, and timeout-recovery consumer paths so release gates match real agent-runtime usage more closely

## [3.0.1] - 2026-04-05

### Changed

- published a copy-pasteable v2-to-v3 migration cookbook and strengthened the v3 release guide around startup, diagnostics, and explicit compatibility-mode guidance
- expanded the v3 release gate to certify both the native startup/discovery path and the explicit compatibility path for diagnostics and human/debug inspection

### Fixed

- improved common v3 compatibility failures so runtime suggestions point callers to `--text`, `--compat v1`, or `--profile human-debug --interactive` instead of forcing migration guidance to live only in docs

## [3.0.0] - 2026-04-04

### Added

- extended the shared `operation` and `receipt` contract family across remaining high-value write commands, including issue assignment/estimate/move/priority, project create and project-label mutation flows, webhook writes, and batch issue creation
- published an agent-native v3 migration guide and rewrote the README and skill/docs stack around AI agent runtimes instead of mixed human/operator usage

### Changed

- changed the default runtime to agent-native execution for core startup, read, and representative write surfaces by making machine-readable JSON the default output mode and relegating human-readable output to the explicit `--text` escape hatch
- removed implicit interactive fallback behavior from startup-critical paths; prompt-driven flows now require explicit `--profile human-debug --interactive`
- made `agent-safe` the default execution profile, so pager-off behavior, longer write timeout defaults, and explicit destructive confirmation semantics are the standard runtime path
- promoted the richer `linear capabilities` schema metadata to the default discovery surface and kept the legacy trimmed shape available only through explicit `--compat v1`

## [2.15.0] - 2026-04-03

### Added

- added a global `--profile agent-safe` execution profile that disables pager by default, extends write timeouts, and requires explicit `--yes` for destructive confirmation flows in automation contexts

### Changed

- added downstream consumer certification to the release gate so startup discovery, resolve, preview/apply, and timeout-recovery paths used by real agent workflows cannot drift silently

## [2.14.0] - 2026-04-03

### Added

- added operation receipts to high-value write JSON results so agents can inspect resolved refs, applied changes, no-op state, partial success, and next safe actions from a shared receipt surface
- unified representative `--dry-run` previews and apply results under the same top-level `operation` contract family for safer plan/apply loops
- added Automation Contract v6 for `linear resolve issue/team/workflow-state/user/label --json`, giving agents a machine-readable reference resolution surface before previewing or applying writes

## [2.13.0] - 2026-04-02

### Added

- enriched `linear capabilities --json --compat v2` with defaults, context resolution hints, input constraints, canonical argv examples, and explicit success/failure envelope fields so agents can assemble commands with less help-text scraping

## [2.12.4] - 2026-04-02

### Added

- enriched `linear capabilities --json --compat v2` with required and optional input metadata, constrained values, stdin/file targets, and structured output contract hints for agents

### Changed

- release-gated the startup-critical agent contracts in CI so the default `linear capabilities --json` shape and core read entrypoints cannot drift silently across releases

### Fixed

- made generated skill docs template-driven so `deno task generate-skill-docs` no longer drifts from the maintained source guidance
- added automated checks that keep contract docs and high-value agent examples aligned with the current CLI version and capabilities compatibility semantics

## [2.12.3] - 2026-03-31

### Fixed

- strengthened `timeout_error` write contracts with machine-readable `appliedState` and `callerGuidance` so callers can distinguish between applied, uncertain, and failed outcomes after reconciliation

## [2.12.2] - 2026-03-31

### Fixed

- restored `linear capabilities --json` to a startup-safe `v1` machine-readable shape by default, while requiring `--compat v2` for richer schema metadata

## [2.12.1] - 2026-03-30

### Added

- added `stateName` to `issue list --json` as an additive convenience field while keeping the nested `state` object unchanged

### Changed

- refreshed the README, agent workflow docs, and skills.sh install guidance to better position `linear-cli` as an agent-first Linear CLI

### Fixed

- preserved agent-first generated skill docs so `deno task generate-skill-docs` no longer reverts the published skill description and command guidance

## [2.12.0] - 2026-03-30

### Added

- added schema-style metadata to `linear capabilities --json` so agents can inspect command arguments, input modes, output semantics, and exit codes without scraping docs
- added Automation Contract v5 coverage for `initiative list/view --json`, `project-update list --json`, and `initiative-update list --json`

### Changed

- upgraded write timeout handling to reconcile against Linear after client-side confirmation timeouts, distinguishing `probably_succeeded`, `definitely_failed`, and `partial_success` outcomes for high-value write commands

## [2.11.0] - 2026-03-30

### Added

- added `linear capabilities --json` so agents can discover supported JSON, dry-run, stdin, confirmation, and retry semantics without scraping help text
- added Automation Contract v4 coverage for `team`, `user`, `workflow-state`, and label read surfaces

### Changed

- standardized write retry semantics with explicit idempotency categories, retry-safe notification archive/read behavior, and shared partial-success metadata

### Fixed

- improved write timeout semantics with distinct `timeout_error` JSON failures, exit code `6`, and clearer partial-success details for combined write flows such as `issue update --comment --json`

## [2.10.0] - 2026-03-30

### Added

- added Automation Contract v3 coverage for `document list/view --json`
- added Automation Contract v3 coverage for `webhook list/view --json`
- added Automation Contract v3 coverage for `notification list/count --json`

## [2.9.1] - 2026-03-29

### Fixed

- stabilized `issue update --comment --json` so the combined update-and-comment path returns reliably to callers and reports machine-readable partial-success details when only the comment step fails

## [2.9.0] - 2026-03-28

### Added

- added stdin / pipeline support to high-value issue write commands and documented the stdin policy for automation use
- added retry-safe relation semantics so repeated `issue relation add/delete` operations can return no-op success instead of failing
- added `--no-pager` compatibility support to `issue create`

### Changed

- standardized confirmation bypass flags on destructive commands around `--yes`, while keeping legacy aliases for compatibility
- expanded agent-focused `--help` examples across automation-tier and major write commands

### Fixed

- improved `-d/--description` parse failures to recommend `--description-file` or stdin for markdown content, and documented the same guidance in help and README

## [2.8.2] - 2026-03-24

### Added

- added rate-limit retry guidance and `error.details.rateLimit` metadata for automation consumers when issue creation hits API throttling

### Changed

- improved `issue list --all` and `--state` handling so `--all` can be combined with an explicit state filter while conflicting `--all-states` usage reports clearer guidance
