# Agent-Only v3 Runtime Guide

This document is the source of truth for the `linear-cli` `v3` line that turns the project from an agent-first CLI into an agent-native runtime.

For copy-pasteable command migration examples, pair this guide with [v2-to-v3-migration-cookbook.md](./v2-to-v3-migration-cookbook.md).

Use it to answer three questions:

1. which `2.x` defaults will flip in `3.0`
2. what human-oriented behavior remains available after `3.0`
3. what the current `v3` line guarantees after the default flips shipped

Current status on `main`:

- core read and startup-critical surfaces already default to machine-readable output
- interactive fallbacks are already explicit
- `agent-safe` is already the default execution profile
- `linear capabilities` already defaults to the richer schema metadata
- representative and remaining high-value writes now expose the `operation` / `receipt` family
- README, contract docs, and skill docs are already written from the agent-native point of view
- source-adjacent intake is already available through normalized context envelopes, deterministic triage, provenance-rich receipts, `resolve pack`, and explicit intake autonomy policies

That means `main` is no longer exploring the direction. It is the active `v3` runtime line. This document should now be read as a runtime and migration guide, not an open design brief.

## Goals

`linear-cli` v3 should make the safest path for agents the default path:

- machine-readable output by default
- fully non-interactive execution by default
- agent-safe execution semantics by default
- startup discovery that is sufficiently schema-like for agent runtimes
- consistent write receipts and preview/apply contracts across high-value mutations

## Non-Goals

v3 is not trying to remove every human debugging path.

The design keeps explicit human/debug escape hatches for:

- styled terminal output
- manual inspection during incident response
- ad-hoc local troubleshooting by maintainers

Those paths become secondary and must be explicitly requested.

## Default Changes In v3

| Surface                     | 2.x default                                                                                            | 3.0 default                                                             |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Output mode                 | styled human text unless `--json` is passed                                                            | machine-readable JSON for core read/write command surfaces              |
| Interactive fallbacks       | some commands still prompt or offer human-oriented fallback flows                                      | missing required input fails fast with actionable guidance              |
| Pager behavior              | command-dependent, with `--profile agent-safe` disabling pager-by-default behavior                     | pager disabled by default                                               |
| Execution profile           | `agent-safe` is opt-in via `--profile agent-safe`                                                      | agent-safe semantics are the default runtime behavior                   |
| Capabilities discovery      | `linear capabilities --json` defaults to richer `v2`; `--compat v1` preserves the legacy startup shape | richer schema metadata remains the default capabilities surface         |
| Write result interpretation | representative high-value writes expose `operation` / `receipt`                                        | remaining target writes are expected to expose the same contract family |

## Human And Debug Escape Hatches

v3 keeps human-oriented behavior only behind explicit opt-in.

The intended steady-state is:

- `--text` is the canonical flag for human-readable terminal output
- `--json` remains accepted, but becomes redundant on command surfaces that already default to JSON
- `--profile human-debug` is the canonical execution-profile escape hatch for prompt and pager oriented debugging
- pager remains available only when the caller explicitly opts in
- destructive confirmation bypass still uses `--yes`

For agent runtimes, read command surfaces in three buckets:

- `stable`: startup-contract or automation-contract surfaces
- `partial`: machine-readable or preview-capable helpers without a full stable apply/read contract
- `escape_hatch`: raw GraphQL and human/debug-only paths

The exact human/debug surface may expand slightly during implementation, but it must stay explicit. Human-oriented behavior must not be the default for startup-critical or automation-tier flows.

## Compatibility And Deprecation Policy

The compatibility policy is intentionally conservative.

### 2.x policy

Before the `v3` defaults shipped, additive migration helpers could be introduced in `2.x`.

Allowed in `2.x`:

- `--text` or equivalent human-output escape hatch
- deprecation warnings for behavior that will flip in `v3`
- migration docs and examples
- preview or experimental flags that let consumers test `v3` behavior explicitly

Historically these defaults were conservative. Current `main` already ships the `v3` runtime defaults on the agent-native surfaces, so any remaining `2.x` references in downstream tooling should be treated as migration debt rather than an active compatibility target.

### v3 policy

The `v3` line is where defaults flipped.

After the `v3` switch:

- agent-native behavior is the default
- human/debug behavior is opt-in only
- startup-critical contracts must stay release-gated
- machine-readable contract changes require explicit release-note callouts

## Downstream Migration Guidance

Downstream consumers should migrate in this order.

1. Stop parsing styled terminal output.
2. Use `linear capabilities --json` or the richer compatibility mode to discover command traits.
3. Treat `operation`, `receipt`, and `error.details` as the canonical execution surface.
4. Pass all required inputs explicitly; do not rely on prompts.
5. Add explicit `--text` and `--profile human-debug --interactive` flags in any manual scripts that still expect terminal text or prompt flows.

Recommended preparation work for consumers moving onto the `v3` line:

- pin to a `2.x` version while migrating
- add tests for startup discovery and representative write flows
- treat the current default runtime semantics as the v3 rehearsal, and keep `--profile human-debug` only for explicit maintainer workflows
- adopt `linear resolve ... --json` before preview/apply loops
- use explicit `--profile human-debug --interactive` only for human/debug prompt flows; do not rely on fallback prompts

### Startup And Diagnostics Migration Examples

When a consumer still uses lightweight startup or diagnostics probes, make the runtime mode explicit instead of relying on older mixed defaults.

```bash
# Legacy startup parser that still expects the trimmed capabilities shape
linear capabilities --compat v1

# Startup or diagnostics checks that need machine-readable team data
linear team list --json

# Human inspection during debugging only
linear team list
linear issue view ENG-123 --text
```

Treat `linear team list --json` as the compatibility-safe diagnostics path for automation. Keep bare `linear team list` only for human inspection, not for parser-driven startup checks.

## Current v3 Guarantees

The following guarantees are what the `v3` line is expected to keep true.

### Design And Docs

- `KYA-310` through `KYA-315` are complete
- this document remains accurate
- README, skill docs, and contract docs describe agent-native defaults
- migration guidance for `2.x -> 3.0` is published

### Runtime Behavior

- core read/write command surfaces default to JSON
- startup-critical flows are fully non-interactive
- agent-safe execution semantics are the default
- richer capabilities schema metadata is the default startup discovery surface
- remaining target write commands expose consistent `operation` / `receipt` contracts

### Migration Readiness

- README and skill docs describe agent-native runtime behavior first
- human/debug mode is clearly documented as secondary and explicit
- a downstream consumer can follow the published migration checklist without relying on tribal knowledge

### Verification

- startup-critical contract tests are updated for v3 defaults
- downstream consumer certification covers at least one real consumer on v3 defaults, plus explicit compatibility-mode startup/diagnostics paths
- release-gated docs and examples match the current CLI version and startup behavior
- CI and release workflows remain green with the new defaults

## Current v3 Readiness

At the time of writing, `main` satisfies the current `v3` runtime direction:

- the project issues `KYA-310` through `KYA-315` are complete
- startup-critical contract tests and downstream consumer certification are already in CI
- docs describe agent-native defaults first and treat human/debug mode as explicit secondary behavior
- source-adjacent intake is now a first-class runtime path through `--context-file`, deterministic triage, provenance-rich receipts, `resolve pack`, and explicit autonomy policies

If any of those bullets stops being true, update this document before treating a new `v3.x` release as ready.

## Issue Mapping

- `KYA-309`: design and migration policy
- `KYA-310`: JSON-by-default output
- `KYA-311`: non-interactive default execution
- `KYA-312`: agent-safe by default
- `KYA-313`: richer capabilities metadata by default
- `KYA-314`: operation/receipt completion across remaining writes
- `KYA-315`: docs rewrite for agent-native runtime
